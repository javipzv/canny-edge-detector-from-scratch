# canny-edge-detector-from-scratch

This project is an implementation from scratch of the Canny edge detector operator in Python. 
The Canny operator is widely used to detect edges in images and consists of several steps, including Gaussian filtering, 
gradient calculation, intensity thresholding, and hysteresis application.
